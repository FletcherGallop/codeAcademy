# Code Academy: Session 2

> Think Like A Programmer in NodeJS

## Introduction
Today we're looking at programming in NodeJS. I

### Learning Objectives
1. Understand what NodeJS and how it relates to Javascript
1. Understand what some basic data types are
2. Know what a variable is
3. Understand what a function is and how you write one

## Part One: NodeJS Basics
You'll have heard me talk about NodeJS and Javascript and perhaps you've heard JSON or "Javascript Object Notation"


- NodeJS - Framework
- Javascript - Language
- JSON - Standardized way of describing an object

## Part Two: Data types
Some programming languages are "typed" and this means that when you're using them you have to know what it is that you're passing around in your variables, when you reference any data then its type or "class" will dictate what it looks like and what you can do with it.

We're using NodeJS, which as we said before is built on Javascript which is not a typed language.

But to understand things later on then it's useful to understand these basic data types and the differences between them.

- Char
- Boolean
- Int
- Double

## Part Three: Variables

## Part Four: Functions


#### If you've finished and there's still time, there is an extension workbook, and a further extension workbook.
