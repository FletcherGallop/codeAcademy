# Code Academy: Session 3 Extended
> Using logic and variables to make a new intent!

## Introduction
So we've now looked at some basic nodeJS, we know how to make variables and use them a bit. We've made some functions. And more recently looked at some logic in NodeJS.

## Intents

### Starting with handler.js
We have the code from last time still available at https://github.com/N0nny/codeAcademy/blob/master/Session1/handler.js. You might notice that some code has been removed since we first used it.

It still contains the ```greetUser``` intent, but now we'll have a go at building on that.
